    SQLFunction getFieldObj method to include the relationship so
    it can be passed through to web services lists to determine all

    save the entry ids for the form and fields so it doesn't have to

    the form id and field ids from the cache when a form is cleaned
    up since this data is relatively small and it keeps from having to
    query the database for this information on imports and migrations
    (when lots of forms are created and destroyed).  Also modified

    of a prepared statement to match changes from 4.1 similar to

    when accessing the user administration page since that needs to
    create user objects.  Also updated validate in I2CE_User_Form to

    Added in option by setting /config/site/single_user to only
    allow a user to be logged in one time.  Subsequent logins will
    logout any previous logins upon their next access.  Also changed
    isLogingFromAnotherPc to isLoggingFromAnotherIP and added it to
    the base mechanism class to avoid errors with other mechanisms.
    This is only checked if /config/site/check_login_ip is set so is
    optional and disabled by default.  4149: Luke Duncan 2015-04-22
    Added in an option to allow multiple instances of unoconv to run
    from I2CE_PageGenerateRelationshipTemplate.  This is to speed
    things up when many are run at the same time as currently they'll
    all share one listener and process sequentially.  If you set
    /modules/PrintedFormsODT/unoconv/allow_multiple to 1 then multiples
